    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>The perfect bowl of cereal involves much more nuance than simply pouring milk and cereal into a bowl.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Your favorite bowl and spoon</li>
        <li>Your preferred cereal</li>
        <li>Freshly squeezed milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Approach your cow, ask them if they are ready to be milked. Once they are ready, proceed to step 2.</li>
        <li>Tickle the udder until it blasts white liquid gold into thine bowl</li>
        <li>Your bowl now full of liquid, walk it carefuly to your chef station, so you do not spill a drop</li>
        <li>Normally, any sane person would pour their cereal before the milk, but this is a special case</li>
        <li>Pour your cereal with the gentle grace of a figure skater gliding across a rink of ice</li>
        <li>Turn on cartoons to enhance the cereal atmosphere</li>
        <li>Eat & Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
