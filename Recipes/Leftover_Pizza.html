    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Sometimes pizza is even better the second day, after it's been sitting in your fridge for a lil' bit.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Yesterday's leftover pizza</li>
        <li>A microwave</li>
        <li>Some ranch if you like that type of thing on your pizza</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Order a large pizza. Eat as much as you can by yourself. If you manage to eat the whole thing, order another, we need leftovers for this recipe</li>
        <li>Wait a day</li>
        <li>Take your leftove pizza out of the fridge and put a slice or two into the microwave</li>
        <li>Heat it up in the microwave for about a minute (give or take 15 seconds depending on how strong your microwave is)</li>
        <li>Let it cool off if it's too hot. Don't wanna burn the roof of your mouth.</li>
